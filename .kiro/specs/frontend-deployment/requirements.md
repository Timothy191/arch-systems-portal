# Frontend Deployment Configuration - Requirements

## User Request
"locate and present audit and if not create a frontend deployment which launches all required for login and pages"

## Restated Requirements
Create a complete frontend deployment configuration that ensures all required components for:
1. User authentication (login functionality)
2. All application pages
3. Required backend dependencies (database, Redis, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Docker-based deployment for local development
- [ ] Production-ready deployment configuration
- [ ] All required services (Next.js frontend, database, Redis)
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Health checks for all services

### 2. Frontend Requirements
- [ ] Next.js 16 application deploys correctly
- [ ] Authentication pages work (login, password reset, etc.)
- [ ] All routes and pages are accessible
- [ ] Static assets served correctly
- [ ] Server-side rendering works

### 3. Backend Dependencies
- [ ] PostgreSQL database for user data
- [ ] Redis for caching and sessions
- [ ] Supabase integration (via environment variables)
- [ ] Connection to external services

### 4. Quality Requirements
- [ ] All services can be started with a single command
- [ ] Configuration is documented
- [ ] Deployment can be tested locally
- [ ] Production and development configurations are separate

### 5. Security Requirements
- [ ] Secrets are injected via environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Database access is properly secured
- [ ] Network isolation between services

## Ambiguities to Resolve

1. **Deployment Target**: Is this for local development, staging, or production?
2. **Authentication Provider**: Are we using Supabase Auth only, or other providers?
3. **Database Requirements**: Do we need seed data or migrations?
4. **Monitoring**: Do we need logging and monitoring setup?
5. **SSL/HTTPS**: Do we need SSL termination or HTTPS configuration?

## Next Steps
Once these requirements are approved, proceed to Design phase to:
- Map which files need to be created/modified
- Define architecture and data flow
- List environment variables needed
- Create implementation plan
