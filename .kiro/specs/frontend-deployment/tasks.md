# Frontend Deployment Configuration - Tasks

## Task 1: Update docker-compose.yml with Frontend Service

### Description
Add the Next.js frontend service to docker-compose.yml with proper configuration for development and dependencies on Redis and PostgreSQL.

### Files to Modify
- `/home/timothy/Projects/docker-compose.yml`

### Acceptance Criteria
- Frontend service definition added
- Service depends on Redis and PostgreSQL
- Health check configured for frontend
- Development volumes for hot reload
- Environment variables injected

### Implementation Steps
1. Add `portal` service to docker-compose.yml
2. Configure build context to `apps/portal`
3. Set up volume mounts for development
4. Add health check endpoint
5. Configure service dependencies
6. Set environment variables

### Quality Gates
- `pnpm quality` passes
- Docker Compose syntax is valid
- All required environment variables documented

## Task 2: Create Production Deployment Configuration

### Description
Create a production-optimized docker-compose.production.yml file with resource limits, SSL configuration, and production settings.

### Files to Create
- `/home/timothy/Projects/docker-compose.production.yml`

### Acceptance Criteria
- Production-optimized configuration
- Resource limits set for all services
- SSL/TLS configuration (if needed)
- Logging configuration
- Health checks for all services

### Implementation Steps
1. Copy existing docker-compose.yml as base
2. Remove development volumes
3. Add resource limits (CPU, memory)
4. Configure production environment variables
5. Set up logging drivers
6. Add health check intervals

### Quality Gates
- Docker Compose syntax valid
- Production settings appropriate
- No development artifacts included

## Task 3: Create Environment Validation Script

### Description
Create a script that validates all required environment variables are set before deployment.

### Files to Create
- `/home/timothy/Projects/scripts/validate-env.sh`

### Acceptance Criteria
- Script validates all required environment variables
- Provides clear error messages
- Works for both development and production
- Can be integrated into deployment scripts

### Implementation Steps
1. Create validation script in scripts directory
2. List all required environment variables
3. Add validation logic for each variable
4. Create helpful error messages
5. Test with missing variables
6. Integrate with deploy scripts

### Quality Gates
- Script runs without errors
- Detects missing variables correctly
- Clear error messages provided

## Task 4: Update Deployment Scripts

### Description
Update existing deploy-dev-mode.sh to support full stack deployment and create production deployment script.

### Files to Modify/Create
- `/home/timothy/Projects/deploy-dev-mode.sh` (update)
- `/home/timothy/Projects/deploy-production.sh` (new)

### Acceptance Criteria
- deploy-dev-mode.sh starts all services
- Production script handles full deployment
- Both scripts validate environment
- Health checks performed
- Error handling included

### Implementation Steps
1. Update deploy-dev-mode.sh for full stack
2. Create deploy-production.sh
3. Add environment validation calls
4. Implement health check polling
5. Add error handling and logging
6. Document usage

### Quality Gates
- Scripts run successfully
- All services start correctly
- Health checks pass
- Error handling works

---

## Task 5: Test Local Deployment

### Description
Test the complete local deployment configuration to ensure all services work together.

### Test Steps
1. Stop any running Docker containers
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
3. Wait for all services to be healthy
4. Test frontend at http://localhost:3000
5. Test login functionality
6. Test database connectivity
7. Test Redis connectivity
8. Verify all pages work

### Acceptance Criteria
- All services start without errors
- Frontend accessible on port 3000
- Login page works
- All application pages render
- Database connections established
- Redis connections work

### Quality Gates
- `pnpm quality` passes
- All tests succeed
- No errors in service logs
