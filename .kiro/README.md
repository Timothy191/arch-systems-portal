# Kiro Agent Configuration & Spec-Driven Workflow

This directory contains agent configurations and templates for the spec-driven workflow mandated by `AGENTS.md`.

## Spec-Driven Workflow

Every non-trivial task (touching more than one file) must follow this three-phase cycle:

### Phase 1: Requirements (`requirements.md`)
1. Restate user request
2. List concrete, testable acceptance criteria
3. Identify ambiguities
4. Define scope boundaries

### Phase 2: Design (`design.md`)
1. Describe architecture and data flow
2. Map server vs client boundaries
3. List files to create/modify
4. Document environment variables, packages, error handling
5. Get user sign-off before implementation

### Phase 3: Tasks (`tasks.md`)
1. Break design into smallest testable units
2. Order tasks with dependencies
3. Mark complete only after `pnpm quality` passes
4. Never skip tasks

## Creating a New Spec

1. Create a new directory under `.kiro/specs/{feature-slug}/`
2. Copy templates:
   ```bash
   cp .kiro/templates/requirements.md .kiro/specs/{feature-slug}/
   cp .kiro/templates/design.md .kiro/specs/{feature-slug}/
   cp .kiro/templates/tasks.md .kiro/specs/{feature-slug}/
   ```
3. Fill in the templates following AGENTS.md guidelines
4. Get user approval at each phase
5. Execute tasks in order

## Agent Configuration

The `default.json` agent configuration enforces:
- Spec-driven workflow for multi-file changes
- AGENTS.md rule compliance
- Technology stack adherence
- Monorepo layout constraints
- Quality gates before/after tasks

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:
1. `pnpm quality` must pass (lint + type-check + test + format)
2. No TypeScript `any` types introduced
3. No secrets committed or exposed
4. Server/client boundaries respected
5. All new environment variables in `.env.example`
6. Error handling uses `@repo/errors` AppError subclasses
7. Accessibility requirements met
8. Alignment Score ≥ 80 (AGENTS.md §20) — `node .cursor/skills/agent-alignment-score/scripts/score.mjs --interactive`
9. Real-world verify: evidence cited (no speculation-as-fact)

## Example

See `.kiro/specs/portal-migration/` for a complete example of the spec-driven workflow in action.
